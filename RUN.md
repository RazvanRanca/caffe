Alex:
-> try new inadcl_o solver mode
-> avoid Redbox Perfects
   -> run inadcl_o_noRedPerfs for 1000 on graphic05 to compare
   -> ok, should not avoid them
-> train inadcl_o more
   -> lr5 non stop
   -> not good (?)
-> freeze backprop
-> look into test_iter
   -> run on graphic02
   -> val_18.txt vs val_19.txt
   -> with alexnet because light enough
   -> 
-> graphic02: 
-> eliminate barcode images with intersect wrongly classified imgs
   over all classes, and propose this as preprocessing step when we
   go to CP

Raz:
-> crash GPU
-> pool classifications for multi image queries
-> write preds.txt file - joint name not image name!!
demo flag names exact, say if merged
